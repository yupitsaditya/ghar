# Ghar
Students move in and out according the opportunites they have at the time, whether it is some internship or project at some other university. But, the lease is a not as flexible as these students. Ghar is a platform to help students sublease their apartments.
Mission is to make sure housing remains affordable and one of the way to do it is to make sure the apartments are not empty.
